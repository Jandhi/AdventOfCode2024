Through trying additions, I found that the following numbers had issues

9
18
22
27


8 bit carry: fcw
9 bit carry: bqw


y09 XOR x09 -> hbs
x09 AND y09 -> kfp
hbs OR bqw -> tfc

kfp XOR fcw -> z09
kfp AND fcw -> bqw
scq OR qsb -> fcw (8 carry)
y08 AND x08 -> scq

gpk XOR tfc -> z10
brf (7 carry) AND ndc -> qsb

9 -> SWAP z09 and tfc CONFIRMED? // no, its kfp hbs
18 -> SWAP dhq and z18 CONFIRMED?
22 -> SWAP z22 and pdg CONFIRMED?
27 -> SWAP z27 and jcp 

dhq,jcp,pdg,tfc,z09,z18,z22,z27
